# Programming in Java: A project Oriented Approach

### Instructor: [Ashish Thapa ](https://github.com/voidash)

### Expected Time : 18 hours/20 hours



This is official mdbook for the proposed programming workshop for the Java. Here you will find the written guides for the workshop. Following is the course structure for the workshop. Please note that this is subject to change as the workshop starts. 

### Assignments
Each session after the first session will be coupled with assignments with a laid out project with certain missing functions that has to be implemented.If the function is implemented correctly then it passes the unit test which marks the completion of assignment. 

## What to expect from the workshop
The students will be able to 
- Where Java is used in the industry and what are some popular java projects and career prospects with Java
- understand the fundamentals of Java
- How to program with a project oriented approach
- [Exploration] Understanding how a java projects are typically structured and understand the concept of 
    - Testing and Code coverage
    - Linting 
    - formatting
- [Project] Understand Networking Libraries in Java, understand how a barebones HTTP server works
- [Project] Understand Various HTTP methods, and have a base to implement their own REST API without using any framework or library.


## What not to expect from the workshop
- Mastery of Java : Java is vast and complex language that has existed since 1995. 16hrs workshop won't be able to cover everything 
- Extensive Hands on experience: Covering a lot of things require skimming over certain portion which will require efforts from students side. I will try to close that gap with assignments but a workshop is simply a nudge which requires a lot of effort from the students side. Each Session will be coupled with lots of resources students will have to explore themselves, but there won't be much of hands on experience on the workshop itself.  
- Won't guarantee a java developer Job
