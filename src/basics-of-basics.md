## Getting Started with Basics in Java and Programming

### 1. Coder vs Programmer
**Coder:** This term often refers to someone who writes code. Coders may have a basic understanding of programming languages and write simple scripts or small programs.

**Programmer:** A programmer is someone with a deeper understanding of programming concepts, algorithms, and software development. Programmers often design, develop, and maintain complex applications and systems.

### 2. Source Code, Program, Script: What's the Difference?
**Source Code:** This is the human-readable set of instructions written in a programming language. It needs to be compiled or interpreted to run on a computer.

**Program:** A program is an executable piece of software that performs a specific task or set of tasks. It is created from source code through a process of compilation or interpretation. Not human readable 

**Script:** A script is a type of program written in an interpreted language. Scripts are usually simpler and smaller than full programs and are often used for automating tasks.

### 3. IDE vs Editor
**IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** An IDE is a comprehensive software suite that provides tools for software development. It typically includes a code editor, compiler/interpreter, debugger, and other features like code completion and version control integration. Examples: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans.

**Editor:** A code editor is a text editor specifically designed for writing and editing code. It may offer syntax highlighting and basic code completion but lacks the extensive tools provided by an IDE. Examples: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++.

### 4. Compiled vs Interpreted Language
**Compiled Language:** In a compiled language, the source code is translated into machine code by a compiler before it is executed. The resulting executable file can be run directly by the computer's hardware. Examples: C, C++.

**Interpreted Language:** In an interpreted language, the source code is executed directly by an interpreter, which reads and executes the code line by line at runtime. Examples: Python, JavaScript.

### 5. What a Virtual Machine Is? 
**Virtual Machine (VM):** A virtual machine is a software emulation of a physical computer. It runs an operating system and applications just like a physical machine but is isolated from the underlying hardware. VMs are used for running applications in a platform-independent manner, providing security, and testing different environments.

**Java Virtual Machine (JVM):** In the context of Java, the JVM is a virtual machine that allows Java programs to run on any device or operating system. The JVM interprets Java bytecode (compiled Java source code) and executes it, providing platform independence.

### 6. Additional Concepts for Java Beginners
**Class and Object:** Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances), which are concrete instances of the class.

**Method:** A method is a block of code within a class that performs a specific task. Methods define the behavior of objects.

**Inheritance:** This OOP concept allows a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (superclass), promoting code reuse.

**Interface:** An interface is a reference type in Java that is similar to a class but only contains abstract methods (methods without a body). Classes can implement interfaces, providing the specific behavior.

**Exception Handling:** Java provides a robust mechanism for handling runtime errors through exceptions. Exceptions are objects representing an error condition, and they can be caught and handled using try-catch blocks. 

**Garbage Collection:** Java automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation through garbage collection, which frees up memory used by objects that are no longer in use.

**Packages:** Packages are used to group related classes and interfaces, providing modularity and namespace management. Java's standard library is organized into packages.
